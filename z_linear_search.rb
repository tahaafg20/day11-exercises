# In Class Exercise: Linear Search
# Write a method, linear_search(array, target), that accepts an array and another input as target
# The method should use the binary search algorithm to return the position of the element where the target is found
# You may not use any Array or Enum methods except length or size
# You may not use any Enum derived iterations, only for, while or until

def linear_search(target, searchfrom)
	for x in searchfrom do
		if x == target
			return searchfrom.index(x)
		end
	end
	"not found"
end
